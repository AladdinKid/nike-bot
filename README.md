Nike-Bot
========

Just a bit of JS + PHP that, when loaded as a Chrome extention, automatically adds the specified shoe size and amount to your cart upon clicking a [@nikestore](http://twitter.com/nikestore) RVSP link when purchasing limited shoe releases from [Nike](http://nike.com) via [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). It . Those two values are set inside [autocart.js](/chrome-extension/autocart.js).

        var size = "12";
        var amount = 1;

Automating the first two steps of picking a size and amount doesn't seem very useful, but when limited release URLs are being hit by literally millions of people at once every second counts.

> Nike's newest release platform is Twitter, sending out unique direct purchase URLs for each shoe release to millions of  thirsty sneakerheads around the globe. Some people started selling a "program" that would automatically add pairs to the  user's cart that would "work on both Mac and PC". 

> This made me think that it was probably just a simple piece code they were using to set the size and amount values upon page load. This, coupled with the fact that they were selling it for $50-100 apiece, made me think I could write my own. Thus, nike-bot.
