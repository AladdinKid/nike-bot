Nike-Bot
========
Just a bit of simple JS + PHP loaded as a Chrome extension in Developer mode. It automatically adds the specified shoe size and amount to your cart upon clicking a @nikestore RVSP link. Those two values are set inside * autocart.js.

        var size = "12";
        var amount = 1;

I enjoy both sneaker culture and coding, so when I saw people trying to get $50-100 for something as simple as this, I decided to try and come up with a free version.
